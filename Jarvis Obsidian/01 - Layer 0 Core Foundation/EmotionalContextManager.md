## 🏛️ Executive Summary & Architectural Role
User Sentiment & Emotional Intelligence Engine.
          Tracks the user's emotional state over the current session.
          Allows Jarvis to "Understand" when to dial down the sass and be more supportive.

`UserMood` is an integral part of `01 - Layer 0 Core Foundation`. It enforces the Jarvis architectural invariant where lower layers provide isolated, crash-proof services to higher-level UI and command execution layers.

---

## ⚙️ Practical Real-World Workflow & Developer Use Cases
Executes core operational logic for `EmotionalContextManager` within the `01 - Layer 0 Core Foundation` subsystem. It provides asynchronous processing, memory-safe data operations, and direct integration with the Jarvis desktop assistant.

### 🎯 Primary Use Cases:
1. **Interactive Workflow**: Direct user triggers via launcher query, hotkey, or holographic HUD button.
2. **Autonomous Background Maintenance**: Unobtrusive polling, memory compaction, and rules synchronization.
3. **Cross-Subsystem Orchestration**: Passing telemetry and state between Layer 0 hardware and Layer 2 overlays.

---

## 🔍 Detailed Breakdown: What Each Component Does
- `Initialize()`: Binds runtime hooks, event listeners, and thread-safe caches.
- `ExecuteWorkloadAsync()`: Offloads high-computation operations to background threads.
- `Dispose()`: Cleans up native OS handles and managed resources.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide & How to Fix Common Errors

### ⚠️ Common Bug: Thread Contention or Stalled Background Worker
- **Root Cause**: Unhandled exception thrown in a background thread or deadlock on shared state lock.
- **Step-by-Step Fix**: Ensure all background loops use `try-catch` blocks and yield execution via `AdaptiveSleeper.Sleep(1000)` or `await Task.Delay()`.

### ⚠️ Common Bug: File Lock Contention during I/O
- **Root Cause**: External IDEs or processes locking files during reading/writing.
- **Step-by-Step Fix**: Always specify `FileShare.ReadWrite | FileShare.Delete` when opening `FileStream` instances.

### 📘 Code Explanation & Technical Walkthrough
- **Asynchronous Execution Pattern**: Offloads execution from the primary UI thread onto managed threadpool threads to maintain 60fps rendering responsiveness.
- **Defensive Exception Handling**: Wraps native I/O and process calls in localized `try-catch` blocks, dispatching diagnostic telemetry logs to `DebugConsoleOverlay`.
- **State Synchronization**: Protects internal fields and collections against thread race conditions using lock synchronization.

## ⚡ Execution Flow & Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Caller as Caller / UI Overlay
    participant Sub as UserMood
    participant Kernel as OS Kernel / Layer 0
    participant Log as DebugConsoleOverlay

    Caller->>Sub: Invoke Action / Query Request
    Sub->>Kernel: Execute Managed & Unmanaged Operations
    Kernel-->>Sub: Operation Result / Status Payload
    Sub->>Log: Emit Diagnostic Telemetry Trace
    Sub-->>Caller: Return Results / Update HUD
```

---

## 🛡️ Defensive Engineering & Guardrails
- **Resource Cleanup**: All native Win32 handles and file streams implement deterministic disposal (`using` declarations or `finally` blocks).
- **Thread Safety**: State variables are guarded via lock synchronization (`private static readonly object _syncLock = new object();`).
- **Telemetry Auditing**: Diagnostic traces are dispatched to `DebugConsoleOverlay` and written to `Data/BOOT_DIAGNOSTICS.log`.
